<h1><font color='red'>Welcome to CICD Project live session..!!<font></h1>
<h2>This is our first CICD Project This error message is coming from a Jenkins build pipeline, specifically from the "Deploy war/ear to a container" step. The error is indicating that the pipeline is unable to find any wars (web archive files) to deploy, and as a result, the deployment process is being aborted.

This error could be caused by a number of things, such as:

The pipeline is not configured to look for wars in the correct location.
The wars are not being built correctly or are not present in the expected location.
The pipeline is not correctly identifying the wars (for example, if the wars have been renamed or are in a different format).
There might be an issue with Jenkins plugin that is responsible for deploying the wars.
To troubleshoot the issue, it would be helpful to check the following:

Verify that the pipeline is configured to look for wars in the correct location.
Check that the wars are being built correctly and are present in the expected location.
Verify that the pipeline is correctly identifying the wars (for example, by checking the file names and formats).
Check the Jenkins plugin version and update it if required.
If you are still facing the issue please share your Jenkins pipeline code and the related Jenkins plugin configurations. It will help me to narrow down the problem. </h2>
